<p2>As you can see, my name is Eric Wang, a Chinese name and an English name. I think this perfectly describes my background: a Chinese born in the West, to be more precise, in New Zealand. With that being said, my mother tongue is Chinese. And culturally, I also identify with China more. I'm not too sure why this is. 
</p>
Of course, this has brought me a lot of problems. I often don't like to answer this question: "Where are you from?". Because when I'm being honest and say: "I'm from New Zealand", then the next question people will ask is, "Why does your English have a Chinese accent?" or: "You don't sound/look like a New Zealander/Kiwi". But if I say: "I am Chinese", when people find that I actually hold a New Zealand passport, then some would think that I am a "dodgy person who runs away from fair competition" (in China, due to the competition for university admission is incredibly high, some parents change their children to foreign nationality to allow them to enter the university easier as the competition is smaller).
</p>
Although I was born in New Zealand, I did not grow up there. In fact, I spent my childhood between New Zealand and China: a few years in New Zealand, then a few years in China, then repeat. I ended up doing the IB program at a private international high school in New Zealand, which in my personal opinion is very challenging. But as always, I adapted well. I got good grades, scholarships, started many cool projects with my friends and so on. After that, I successfully being admitted to the Chinese University of Hong Kong to study Psychology. To be honest, I did not consider going to school in Hong Kong; my first choice at that time was the UK, followed by Australia. However, CUHK offered a very high amount of scholarships. Education is always expensive, and I assume any top 50 universities would be approximately the same in terms of undergraduate. So I ended up in CUHK. And it turns out to be a good choice! I met many professors that are really supportive and I enjoyed those knock-and-talk office hours. I met quite a number of interesting students who indeed, are very ambitious. And finally, I got so many opportunities that enables me to achieve what I want. I did not regret it.
</p>
Currently, I am working to become a researcher in the field of cognitive psychology. I think there are many very interesting topics in this field that associate with us so much. I cannot speak too much about the topic as I am still an undergraduate student. Still, I think my interest is in working memory and perception. I  also start to look at the problem of consciousness. If you are also interested in these exciting topics, just send me an email!
</p>
Finally, like any other teenager, I have a great interest in Japanese anime. I really want to learn Japanese, but I have not yet done so because I'm too lazy. Maybe one of my goals for the university is to learn it before I graduate. Other than that, I like listening to J-Pop, and playing rhythm games, or playing my Switch. For more details, go to Fun.
