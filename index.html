<p1>My name is Eric Wang and welcome to my personal website!
</p>
I'm an undergraduate student who now is receiving all-rounded training in Cognitive Science. I am currently pursueing 2 degrees. One in Bachelor of Social Science Majoring in Psychology at <a href="https://www.psy.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php/" class="body">the Department of Psychology </a> and Linguistics at <a href="http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/" class="body">the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages </a> in <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html" class="body">The Chinese University of Hong Kong </a> with a minor in statistics. And another one in Bachelor of Science Majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/colleges-schools-and-institutes/college-of-sciences/school-of-mathematical-and-computational-sciences/" class="body">the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences </a> in <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/" class="body">The Massey University of New Zealand | te kunenga ki pūrehuroa </a>. I have a great interest in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Because to understand the world, we must understand ourselves – And to understand ourselves, we must study the brain. Currently, I am interested in using neural modeling and brain imaging techniques to understand working memory and auditory perception, but I am more than happy to explore other related topics.
